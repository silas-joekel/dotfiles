# Dotfiles of Silas JÃ¶kel

This repository was created to store my dotfiles.
I am using a bare repo for easy use, have a look at this [article from Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) for more information.
As the base for my machines I am using [Manjaro i3](https://manjaro.org/downloads/community/i3/).
